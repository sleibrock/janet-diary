The Diary of Janet
===

:musical_note: Something's getting in the way, something's just about to break :musical_note:

The Diary of Janet is my personal project and deep-dive into the hit programming language [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/). There are not many resources on doing many things with Janet, probably due to popularity, but I have reason to think Janet is a pretty neat language.

The goal will be to fill out at least **thirty** different programs. I think that is the minimum number of programs one should make to consider themselves proficient enough in a language.

* Programs can range from simple to complex, preferrably one-file
* One program should at least incorporate a custom macro
* Explore a multitude of application domains; audio, 2D and 3d, network, etc
* At least one Mandelbrot program
* At least one Raytracer
* probably some others
